# Python-Stock-Screener
This is a stock screener me and my other mates developed. It was a school project that we used to demonstrate to our teachers and parents regarding how much we have learned from school. We developed this project initially because my friends father wanted a stock screener in order to decide which stocks are best in the current market his stocks as he is a trader.

So we decided to make him a stock screener, a free one. It took us a couple of weeks to make this, but with balancing other school work and an upcoming AS Levels Exam, some ideas regarding web development had to be cancelled. Thus we decided to just make the function of the stock screener in which we used python to make.
